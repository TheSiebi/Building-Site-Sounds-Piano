# Building Site Sounds Piano

Simple Unity WebGL application that uses pitch-shifting to turn sound effects recorded at a building site into instruments, playable through a keyboard. Try it out [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/building-site-sounds-piano).

Note that the option of adding custom sound clips is removed in the WebGL build. If you want to use this option, download the Windows build available under [Releases](https://github.com/TheSiebi/Building-Site-Sounds-Piano/releases/latest).
